# TicTacToe
Mod 1 Solo Project

# Objective
The objective for this project is to design a 2-player interactive and responsive TicTacToe game. I will demonstrate my understanding of DOM and design in HTML/CSS files; functions and event delegation in JS in 3 different JS files for their respective purposes; and local storage to persist and display users' win records.

# Planning
This solo project will use Atom as a text editor, Github Projects as a project management tool (https://github.com/leighlars/tictactoe/projects), MDN and lesson plans as references, and the employment of mentors for code feedback, guidance, and the "rubber duck" code comprehension method.

This is a 6-day project. The estimated timeline is as follows:
* Thursday pm: complete set-up, wireframes, build crude yet functional HTML/CSS, create classes for JS files
* Friday / Saturday: establish functionality for a functional game completion, including resetting the game board
* Sunday: displaying and persisting player data in sidebars (local storage)
* Monday: make the game pretty!! Polish code for DRY, SRP, dev empathy.

# Progression
4/16/2020: Created private repo, cloned repo into local folder, wire-framed the HTML/CSS, and wrote out expected functions, crude rendering of HTML/CSS, created src folder with 3 JS files.
